CREATE PUBLICATION adds a new publication into the current database. The
publication name must be distinct from the name of any existing publication in the current database.

Each publication exists in only one database.

(1) Creating a publication at source database (192.168.0.48)
   $sudo -u postgres psql

(2) Connect to the database (e.g., powerworks_d1)
  postgresql=# \c powerworks_d1  => connect to the DB

(3) Create publication:
    powerworks_d1=# CREATE PUBLICATION pychart_publication FOR ALL TABLES;

(4) Ensure all the tables (from soruce DB) have been recreated at subscriber node

(5) Create subscription and give it the name pychart_subscription:
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION adds a new subscription for the **current** database. The subscription name must be
distinct from the name of any existing subscription in the database.

$sudo -u postgres psql

postgres=# \c powerworks_d1
        You are now connected to database "powerworks_d1" as user "postgres".

powerworks_d1=# CREATE SUBSCRIPTION pychart_subscription
            CONNECTION 'postgresql://winter:winter@192.168.0.48:5432/powerworks_d1'
            PUBLICATION pychart_publication;


If replication doesn’t seem to be working, a good first step is checking the PostgreSQL
log on db-replica for any possible errors:
•	sudo tail /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-13-main.log
